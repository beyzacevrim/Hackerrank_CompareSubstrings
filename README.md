# Hackerrank_CompareSubstrings

We define the following terms:<br>
A < B < C < . . . < Y <  Z< a < b  < c< . . . < y < z<br>
- Lexicographical Order, also known as alphabetic or dictionary order, orders characters as follows:<br>
For example, ball < cat, dog < dorm, Happy < happy, Zoo < ball.

- A substring of a string is a contiguous block of characters in the string. For example, the substrings of abc are a, b, c, ab, bc, and abc.<br>

Given a string,s , and an integer,k , complete the function so that it finds the lexicographically smallest and largest substrings of length k.
